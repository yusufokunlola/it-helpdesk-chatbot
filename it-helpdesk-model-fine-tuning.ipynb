However, it's still possible to make them become more knowledgeable in specific domains by finetuning them. In this project, we will finetune Google Gemma LLM with a question-and-answer dataset centered around IT Helpdesk topics.\n\nThe goal is to transform Gemma into a domain expert in the field of cybersecurity, specifically designed to act as a IT Helpdesk. This project will enhance Gemma’s ability to provide accurate, helpful responses to IT Helpdesk-related queries.\n\nMore details about this project:\n* https://github.com/yusufokunlola/it-helpdesk-chatbot\n","metadata":{"id":"lSGRSsRPgkzK","papermill":{"duration":0.008475,"end_time":"2024-02-21T09:37:33.854882","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-02-21T09:37:33.846407","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"_kg_hide-output":true}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Install dependencies\n","metadata":{"id":"m4enlpwvIu-3","papermill":{"duration":0.008687,"end_time":"2024-02-21T09:37:33.906835","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-02-21T09:37:33.898148","status":"completed"},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Install Keras 3 last.

In conclusion, after fine-tuning the model using LoRA with the IT Helpdesk questions and answers dataset, we observed significant improvements in its ability to respond to IT Helpdesk-related prompts. \nThe model now provides more accurate and relevant answers, such as with the ransomware question, demonstrating its enhanced performance in this domain. By leveraging LoRA, we were able to fine-tune the model efficiently with fewer computational resources, making the process both cost-effective and impactful. Overall, this approach has successfully strengthened the model's capability in addressing IT Helpdesk topics.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<!-- # Save the finetuned model \npreset_dir = \".\\gemma2_2b_it_helpdesk\"\ngemma_lm.save_to_preset(preset_dir)\n\n/kaggle/input/gemma/keras/gemma_2b_en/1 -->","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-10-11T14:22:43.778139Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-10-11T14:22:43.778624Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-10-11T14:22:43.778361Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-10-11T14:22:43.778386Z"},"_kg_hide-input":true}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# # Fine-tuning the model\n# preset_dir = \"/kaggle/working/gemma2_2b_it_helpdesk\"\n# gemma_lm.save_to_preset(preset_dir)\n\n# # Archive the saved model\n# import shutil\n# shutil.make_archive(\"/kaggle/working/gemma2_2b_it_helpdesk\", 'zip', preset_dir)\n\n# print(\"Model saved and archived successfully!\")","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-12-07T23:49:21.741239Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-12-07T23:49:21.741585Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-12-08T00:26:32.969426Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-12-07T23:49:21.741560Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-12-08T00:26:32.968409Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Model saved and archived successfully!\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":29},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"import kagglehub\nfrom kagglehub.config import get_kaggle_credentials\nkagglehub.login() ","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-10-11T14:22:43.780551Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-10-11T14:22:43.781085Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-10-11T14:22:43.780809Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-10-11T14:22:43.780835Z"},"_kg_hide-input":true}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"kaggle_credentials = get_kaggle_credentials()\nusername = kaggle_credentials.username  \nkaggle_uri = f\"kaggle://{username}/gemma2-cybersecurity/keras/gemma2_2b_cyber_security\"\nkeras_nlp.upload_preset(kaggle_uri, preset_dir)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-10-11T14:22:43.783550Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-10-11T14:22:43.783963Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-10-11T14:22:43.783781Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-10-11T14:22:43.783801Z"},"_kg_hide-input":true}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Refrences\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/code/awsaf49/kaggle-qa-with-gemma-kerasnlp-starter\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/code/nilaychauhan/fine-tune-gemma-models-in-keras-using-lora","metadata":{}}]}
